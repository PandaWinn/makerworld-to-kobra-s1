# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project follows the principles of **Keep a Changelog** and uses **Semantic Versioning**.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added
- Retargeted the extension from Snapmaker U1 to the Anycubic Kobra S1
  (Anycubic Slicer Next): Kobra S1 template pack with 11 genuine
  Anycubic system-tuned process profiles (0.08mm–0.28mm, plus 0.20mm High
  Quality), Kobra printer identity (250x250 bed), and fully rebranded UI,
  icons, and packaging for Chrome and Firefox.

### Changed
- Converted files now carry the `-KobraS1` suffix and resolve to
  `0.20mm Standard @Anycubic Kobra S1 0.4 nozzle` family presets.
- Internal identifiers renamed from U1 to KS1 (no behavior change).

### Removed
- Parked the experimental one-click native-messaging bridge (download-only
  for now). Design, code, and the Firefox temporary-ID finding are preserved
  on branch `archive/slicer-bridge` and in `docs/one-click-open-bridge.md`.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-09-13

### Added
- Added an optional **Force converted download filename** compatibility setting for Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers.
- Added explicit filename forcing for converted downloads to work around cases where Chromium saves the generated project with a random filename or without the `.3mf` extension.

### Improved
- Improved converted-file download diagnostics to report whether filename forcing was enabled and applied.
- Clarified in the settings that filename forcing is only intended as a compatibility workaround and should remain disabled when downloads already work correctly.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-09-10

### Improved
- Added direct access to the converter settings by clicking the browser extension icon.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- Restored MakerWorld downloads after MakerWorld changed the authenticated 3MF download request from `fetch` to `XMLHttpRequest`.
- Added XMLHttpRequest capture support while keeping the existing fetch capture as a fallback.
- Prevented stale or cancelled download responses from satisfying later conversion attempts.
- Improved MakerWorld download error handling with separate trigger, capture, HTTP, timeout and output-download error codes.
- Fixed the conversion error dropdown after MakerWorld changed the structure of its download menu.

### Improved
- Made MakerWorld download-dropdown detection more robust by relying on structure and geometry instead of translated text or generated CSS class names.
- Improved error reports with extension version, browser, capture transport, HTTP status and response type.
- Added capture information to the project report.
- Improved developer console output for successful XMLHttpRequest captures.

## [1.5.3] - 2026-08-06

### Added
- Added support for MakerWorld China (`makerworld.com.cn`).

## [1.5.2] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed
- Improved MakerWorld printer filter detection across different layouts, viewport sizes and responsive DOM variants.
- Fixed the Snapmaker U1 option not appearing when MakerWorld kept multiple printer carousels in the DOM.
- Fixed the visible MakerWorld primary action button not switching to the converter interface when hidden responsive button copies were present.
- Added a safe Swiper visibility repair fallback for cases where the U1 option is inserted but remains outside the visible printer list.

### Changed
- Expanded the MakerWorld UI integration report with printer carousel, primary button and visibility diagnostics.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-08-01

### Added
- Official extension logo

### Improved

- Improved download filename compatibility by automatically retrying downloads with a normalized filename if the browser rejects the original filename as invalid, while preserving the original filename whenever possible.
- Improved download diagnostics by recording both the original and normalized filename attempts in the Project Report and Error Report to simplify troubleshooting.

### Fixed

- Fixed converted file downloads failing for certain Unicode filenames that could be rejected by the browser as `Invalid filename`.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- Added a built-in conversion error system with stable error codes and troubleshooting suggestions.
- Added an integrated error report that can be copied directly to the clipboard with a single click.
- Added detailed diagnostic reports in the browser console to simplify troubleshooting and bug reporting.

### Improved

- Improved conversion button alignment and text centering.
- Improved handling of repeated conversions by automatically closing open status panels before starting a new conversion.
- The original MakerWorld "Open in Bambu Studio" / "Download 3MF" button is now preserved and restored after each conversion.

### Fixed

- Fixed several button state restoration edge cases after completed conversions.
- Fixed multiple UI issues that could leave outdated status information visible after starting another conversion.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-07-23

### Improved

- Improved OrcaSlicer compatibility by automatically normalizing several required filament arrays.
- Improved compatibility with MakerWorld projects containing more than four filament slots.
- Improved handling of invalid `raft_first_layer_expansion` values by restoring the native U1 profile default.

### Fixed

- Fixed an OrcaSlicer crash caused by empty `filament_adaptive_volumetric_speed` entries.
- Fixed invalid project configuration warnings caused by inconsistent `filament_self_index` values.
- Fixed `filament_flush_temp` warnings shown when opening converted projects.
- Fixed negative `raft_first_layer_expansion` values causing compatibility warnings in Snapmaker Orca and OrcaSlicer.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Added optional OrcaSlicer compatibility mode.
- Added support for importing custom OrcaSlicer printer profiles.

### Improved

- Improved the converter settings page with a redesigned printer profile management section.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Added automatic positioning correction for multi-plate MakerWorld projects.
- Added automatic compensation for differences between the source printer and Snapmaker U1 build-plate centers and plate-grid spacing.
- Added multi-plate diagnostics to the converter report, including detected grid dimensions, adjusted and skipped plates, unresolved instances, center offset, grid difference and maximum movement.
- Added a converter option for enabling or disabling multi-plate positioning correction.

### Improved

- Improved preservation of filament-specific project settings for preserved source filaments.
- Improved handling of Bambu filament setting arrays that contain paired current and default values.
- Improved safety of multi-plate conversion by validating every instance before changing a plate.
- Multi-plate positioning now leaves an entire plate unchanged if any instance cannot be linked or positioned safely.
- Single-plate projects remain unchanged by the multi-plate positioning feature.

### Fixed

- Fixed **Maximum Volumetric Speed** and other per-filament settings being read from the wrong array position in some MakerWorld projects.
- Fixed preserved project filaments potentially receiving incorrect or unrelated filament values in Snapmaker Orca.
- Fixed objects from multi-plate MakerWorld projects appearing on incorrect plate positions after conversion to the Snapmaker U1 build-plate layout.
